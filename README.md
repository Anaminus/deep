# Deep
The `deep` package provides deep comparisons with human-readable differences and
configurable tolerances. Useful for testing.

This project derives from several others:

- [reflect.DeepEqual](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#DeepEqual)
- [github.com/go-test/deep](https://github.com/go-test/deep)
